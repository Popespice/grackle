"""Pure reconstruction of a call/return stream from a V8 CPU sampling profile.

This is the **faithful** channel of the Node/V8 runtime adapter (ADR-0022). The V8
sampling profiler (``Profiler.start`` → ``Profiler.stop``) returns a *merged call
tree* plus a temporal list of samples (one tree-node id per sample tick) and the
inter-sample time deltas — the same shape as a ``.cpuprofile`` file. A sampled call
tree *is* a flame graph, so reconstructing a ``call``/``return`` stream from it
feeds the Phase-8.2 flame infra directly.

The function is pure and Node-free: it takes the profile dict plus a ``resolve``
callback (callFrame → grackle node ID, or ``None`` to filter the frame), so it is
unit-tested from a captured ``.cpuprofile`` fixture with no Node in the loop.

Algorithm — stack-diff over samples, by V8 tree-node identity:

- Each tree node is a unique root→leaf *call path*; the path of tree-node ids from
  root to the sampled node IS the call stack at that sample. Recursion and
  multiple call sites of the same function map to *distinct* tree nodes, so
  comparing paths by tree-node id correctly tells "same frame instance" from
  "different frame".
- Per sample, the *filtered* stack keeps only frames that ``resolve`` to a project
  node (pseudo-frames / ``node:internal`` / out-of-project files drop out, exactly
  as the Python tracer's ``sys.monitoring.DISABLE`` skips non-project code).
- Consecutive filtered stacks are diffed: frames present before but not now are
  closed (``return``, deepest first); frames present now but not before are opened
  (``call``, shallowest first). ``frame_depth`` is the 0-based index in the
  filtered stack, so a ``call`` and its matching ``return`` carry the *same* depth
  — the invariant the Phase-8.2 call-tree builder relies on.
- ``ts_ns`` is the cumulative sample time (``startTime + Σ timeDeltas``,
  microseconds → nanoseconds). All frames collapse to ``thread_id = 0`` (single V8
  isolate; worker threads are out of scope → Phase 9).

Known characteristic (documented in ADR-0022): because this is a CPU profile, time
the main thread spends *off-CPU* (``(idle)`` samples) closes the project stack and a
later sample reopens it. For synchronous CPU work this is a no-op; for async gaps it
fragments a frame into multiple spans — faithful to "what was on-CPU".
